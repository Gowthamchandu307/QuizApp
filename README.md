# Course Intro and Resources
Welcome to "Build a Quiz App with HTML, CSS, and JS". I'm so excited you decided to take the initiative to improve your core Web Development skills!

In this course, we are going to use fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to build a quiz application. This application will be able to load questions from a 3rd party API, track and display high scores, and so much more! You'll learn how to use Local Storage, create animations, use modern ES6 JavaScript features, and more.
***
# 1. Create and Style the Home Page
we are going to create the home page along with a good chunk of the necessary CSS. The home page will consist of a few links for the Game and High Scores pages. We will also create helper CSS classes for Flexbox, buttons, and hiding elements.
***
I encourage you all to take a look at Emmet snippets for generating HTML and CSS.
# 2. Create and necessary functions 
we will create the functions and display static question and answer information. Eventually, we will load questions from an API, but for now, we will hard code one question so to establish styling.
